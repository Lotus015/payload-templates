=== Iteration 1 - S1 - 2026-01-19 ===
Status: COMPLETE
Learnings:
- pnpm workspaces work with empty directories (only .gitkeep files)
- pnpm install succeeds even without any packages in workspaces
- Root package.json needs "private": true for monorepo setup
- Used .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories in git
- Test passed: pnpm install completed successfully

=== Iteration 2 - S2 - 2026-01-19 ===
Status: COMPLETE
Learnings:
- ES modules require "type": "module" in package.json
- kleur works well for simple colorized CLI output
- Shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) required for CLI bin executables
- pnpm automatically picks up new workspace packages on install
- Removed .gitkeep after adding real files to cli/ directory
- Test passed: node cli/bin/index.js displays welcome message

=== Iteration 3 - S3 - 2026-01-19 ===
Status: COMPLETE
Learnings:
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires @tailwindcss/postcss package (not tailwindcss directly as PostCSS plugin)
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses CSS-based config with @import "tailwindcss" instead of tailwind.config.js
- Next.js 16 automatically modifies tsconfig.json (jsx changed to react-jsx, include updated)
- Next.js 16 with Turbopack shows workspace root warning when multiple lockfiles detected
- pnpm workspaces automatically install dependencies from sub-packages
- Test passed: cd templates/premium && pnpm install && pnpm build

=== Iteration 4 - S4 - 2026-01-19 ===
Status: COMPLETE
Learnings:
- Payload CMS 3.x has peer dependency warning with Next.js 16 (expects Next.js 15.x) but builds successfully
- Payload 3.x uses handleServerFunctions from @payloadcms/next/layouts instead of payload.serverFunction()
- Admin routes require (payload) route group with [[...segments]] dynamic catch-all
- API routes need separate handlers for REST (/api/[[...slug]]) and GraphQL (/api/graphql)
- @payload-config TypeScript path alias required in tsconfig.json
- sass package required for Payload admin SCSS styles
- importMap.js exports an empty object by default, populated when custom components are added
- graphql package is a required dependency for Payload 3.x
- Test passed: cd templates/premium && pnpm build

=== Iteration 5 - S5 - 2026-01-19 ===
Status: COMPLETE
Learnings:
- Payload CMS 3.x collections can be defined as separate files with CollectionConfig type
- Collections use export barrel (index.ts) for clean imports in payload.config.ts
- Group field type allows nested field structures (used for hero section in Pages)
- Upload collection with mimeTypes filter restricts allowed file types
- Relationship to media collection uses `type: 'upload'` with `relationTo: 'media'`
- TypeScript types (payload-types.ts) are generated when Payload runs with DB connection, not at build time
- Build compilation validates collection schemas without requiring DB connection
- Test passed: cd templates/premium && pnpm build
